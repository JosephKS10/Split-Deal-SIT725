A RESTful API for group buying deals with JWT authentication

## Docker Deployment  

### Prerequisites  
- Docker installed ([Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop))  
- Docker Compose (included with Docker Desktop)  

### Quick Start    
1. **Start all services (app + MongoDB)**:  
   ```bash  
   docker-compose up -d

### Detailed Setup
1. **Application & Database**:
   # Build and run with MongoDB
   ```bash  
   docker-compose up -d app
   
4. Access the application <br>
   Main app: http://localhost:3000 <br>
   Student API: http://localhost:3000/api/student <br>

5. **Expected API Output**
    ```bash
    {  
    "name": "Your Name",  
    "studentId": "YourStudentID"  
    }
6. Notes
  Ensure the .env file is present for database connectivity. <br>
  Use docker logs <container_id> to debug startup issues. <br>
  Use docker ps to check which all containers are working

1. **Application & Database**:
   # Run unit tests
   ```bash  
   docker-compose run test-unit

Feautes of docker -
Local MongoDB Container - No cloud dependency
Isolated Testing - Dedicated containers for unit/e2e tests
Auto-Cleaning - Test database resets between runs
Health Checks - Ensures DB readiness before app starts
